        availability: true,
        details: "The pizza, drizzled only with olive oil, topped with sliced ​​tomatoes and oregano or basil , has been documented since around the mid-1800s, when the tomato became popular in southern Italy . The name is probably older – the Apulian pizza pugliese or the Calabrian pitta inchiusa, for example, contain only ingredients that have been known for a long time, such as olive oil, onions , salt or lard , in addition to yeast dough . Flatbreads similar to Ligurian focaccia have been common since ancient times. Because pizza at very hightemperature should be baked, which was not possible in most households, it was initially prepared and brought unbaked to the local baker, until a separate branch of the pizza maker, the pizzaiolo , emerged, who made the dough and topped it himself."

        availability: true,
        details: "The term burger can also be applied to the meat patty on its own, especially in the United Kingdom, where the term patty is rarely used, or the term can even refer simply to ground beef. Since the term hamburger usually implies beef, for clarity burger may be prefixed with the type of meat or meat substitute used, as in beef burger, turkey burger, bison burger, portobello burger, or veggie burger. In Australia and New Zealand, a piece of chicken breast on a bun is known as a chicken burger, which would generally not be considered to be a burger in the United States; Americans would generally call it a chicken sandwich, but in Australian English and New Zealand English a sandwich requires sliced bread (not a bun), so it would not be considered a sandwich.Hamburgers are typically sold at fast-food restaurants, diners, and specialty and high-end restaurants. There are many international and regional variations of hamburgers."

        availability: true,
        details: "The word ramen is a Japanese borrowing of the Mandarin Chinese lāmiàn (拉麵, pulled noodles).[2][3] However, historian Barak Kushner argues that this borrowing occurred retroactively and that various independent Japanese corruptions of Chinese words had already led to Japanese people calling this Chinese noodle dish ramen.[4] One theory suggests that the Japanese mistook the Chinese particles le (了) or la (啦, a contraction of 了啊)[4] for a ra sound when Chinese cooks would announce hăo le (好了) to communicate that a dish was complete. The Japanese then appended the word men (麵, meaning 'noodle') to the ra to create the word ramen.[5]"

Subsequent parts of the entry, however, refer to steak fish, which referred to cod of a size suitable for cutting into steaks, and also steakraid, which was a custom among Scottish Highlanders of giving some cattle being driven through a gentleman's land to the owner.[5] An early written usage of the word stekys comes from a 15th-century cookbook, and makes reference to both beef or venison steaks.[6]"
